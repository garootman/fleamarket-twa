we are building a template for a telegram-web-app + bot, deployed at cloudflare.
the app idea is "twitter-like-feed" where any user can add content. feed is the same for everybody, shown new-to-old.
each post has title + text + may (or not) have up to 3 images.
use car edit or hide \ delete his own posts.
user can see his own posts (my posts).
has pagination
has a "me" ur "other user" page - with link to all his posts.
when user creates a post, he gets a message from bot. 


the main thing is to get it working with reasonable amount of manual user's actions (written in readme), that any dummy user can do: just git fork \ clone  this tpl, enter bot-token, CF accout to screts, etc, and here is your working app.
