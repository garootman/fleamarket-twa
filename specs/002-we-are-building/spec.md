# Feature Specification: Telegram Web App + Bot Template Initial Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `002-we-are-building`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we are building a template for a telegram-web-app + bot, deployed at cloudflare. let's make first step and make a working deployment with all necesary secrets, data, settings, etc, and make a good readme for the start-how-to. on /start in bot - user sees "hello world". on opening web-app user also sees the "hello world" page. just init. look at stack.md for tech"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Creating minimal working Telegram Web App + Bot template
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Bot users, Web app users
   � Actions: Send /start command, Open web app
   � Data: Simple "Hello World" messages
   � Constraints: Cloudflare deployment, working secrets management
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All aspects are clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Bot interaction and web app access scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Minimal entities for basic functionality
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: How should Telegram webhook URLs be managed across environments to avoid conflicts and ensure proper routing? → A: Use separate bot tokens per environment with environment-specific webhook URLs (with accurate Cloudflare-provided URLs during deployment)
- Q: How should environment variables be distributed across GitHub Secrets, Cloudflare Secrets, wrangler.toml, and local env files to minimize redundancy? → A: GitHub Secrets for CI/CD only, Cloudflare Secrets for runtime, wrangler.toml for non-sensitive config
- Q: What should happen when GitHub workflow deployment fails due to missing or invalid secrets? → A: Fail fast with clear error messages indicating which specific secrets are missing
- Q: How should local development environment handle Telegram webhook testing without interfering with preview/production? → A: Use cloudflared tunnel with separate local bot token and dedicated webhook endpoint
- Q: What validation should occur before deploying to ensure the template works correctly across all three environments? → A: envs present

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users should be able to interact with a basic Telegram bot and access a companion web application, both showing "Hello World" messages. This serves as a foundational template that developers can build upon for more complex Telegram Web App projects.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has access to the Telegram bot, **When** they send the /start command, **Then** they receive a "Hello World" message
2. **Given** a user opens the Telegram Web App, **When** the app loads, **Then** they see a "Hello World" page
3. **Given** a developer wants to deploy the template, **When** they follow the README instructions, **Then** they can successfully deploy both bot and web app to Cloudflare
4. **Given** the template is deployed, **When** users interact with either the bot or web app, **Then** both components function independently and correctly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the bot is offline or unresponsive?
- How does the web app handle network failures during loading?
- What occurs if deployment secrets are missing or incorrect? (System must fail fast with clear error messages)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Bot MUST respond to /start command with "Hello World" message
- **FR-002**: Web app MUST display "Hello World" page when opened
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide comprehensive deployment documentation including step-by-step instructions in README and supporting guides
- **FR-004**: System MUST include all necessary secrets configuration examples with separate bot tokens per environment
- **FR-005**: System MUST separate CI/CD secrets (GitHub) from runtime secrets (Cloudflare) with non-sensitive config in wrangler.toml
- **FR-006**: System MUST fail deployment fast with clear error messages when secrets are missing or invalid
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically configure webhook URLs using Cloudflare-provided endpoints during deployment
- **FR-008**: System MUST deploy successfully to Cloudflare Workers and Pages
- **FR-009**: Web app MUST integrate with Telegram Web App SDK for basic functionality
- **FR-010**: System MUST include environment setup for local development using cloudflared tunnel with isolated bot token
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate all required environment variables are present before deployment
- **FR-012**: Template MUST serve as a working foundation for future development

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Bot**: Represents the Telegram bot that responds to user commands
- **Web App**: Represents the Telegram Web App accessible through the bot
- **User**: Telegram users who interact with either the bot or web app
- **Deployment Configuration**: Environment variables, secrets, and settings required for Cloudflare deployment
