# Research: Telegram Web App + Bot Template

## Technology Stack Research

### Decision: Cloudflare Workers + Hono.js for Backend
**Rationale**:
- Hono.js is lightweight, TypeScript-first framework optimized for edge computing
- Excellent performance on Cloudflare Workers with minimal cold start time
- Built-in middleware for CORS, authentication, validation
- Strong ecosystem compatibility with Zod for schema validation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Express.js (heavier, not optimized for edge)
- Fastify (good performance but less edge-optimized)
- Plain Cloudflare Workers (more verbose, less developer ergonomics)

### Decision: React + Vite for Frontend
**Rationale**:
- Vite provides fast development with HMR and optimized builds
- React has mature Telegram Web App integration via @twa-dev/sdk
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Optimal build output for Cloudflare Pages

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vue.js (smaller ecosystem for Telegram integrations)
- Svelte (smaller bundle but less Telegram ecosystem)
- Vanilla JS (faster but less maintainable for template)

### Decision: Drizzle ORM + Cloudflare D1
**Rationale**:
- Drizzle ORM is TypeScript-first with excellent D1 support
- Type-safe queries with minimal runtime overhead
- Migrations support for schema evolution
- Cloudflare D1 provides SQLite with global replication

**Alternatives considered**:
- Prisma (heavier, less optimized for edge)
- Raw SQL (less type safety, more verbose)
- KV-only storage (too limited for relational data)

### Decision: Environment-Specific Bot Tokens
**Rationale**:
- Prevents webhook conflicts between environments
- Enables isolated testing without affecting production
- Allows different bot configurations per environment
- Supports parallel development workflows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single bot with path routing (complex webhook management)
- Manual switching (error-prone, not automated)
- Domain-based routing (requires multiple domains)

### Decision: Secrets Management Strategy
**Rationale**:
- GitHub Secrets for CI/CD keeps deployment tokens secure
- Cloudflare Secrets for runtime ensures production security
- wrangler.toml for non-sensitive config enables version control
- Clear separation reduces accidental exposure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single secret store (creates security risks)
- Environment files (not secure for production)
- Manual secret management (error-prone)

### Decision: cloudflared tunnel for Local Development
**Rationale**:
- Provides secure HTTPS tunnel required by Telegram
- Integrates well with Cloudflare ecosystem
- Enables real webhook testing locally
- Automatic certificate management

**Alternatives considered**:
- ngrok (external dependency, quota limits)
- Local proxy server (complex SSL setup)
- Mock webhook responses (not realistic testing)

## Integration Patterns Research

### Telegram Web App SDK Integration
**Best Practices**:
- Always call `Telegram.WebApp.ready()` on app initialization
- Use `Telegram.WebApp.expand()` for full-screen experience
- Handle `themeChanged` events for dark/light mode
- Handle `viewportChanged` events for responsive design
- Validate `initData` server-side with HMAC-SHA256

### Cloudflare Workers Deployment Patterns
**Best Practices**:
- Use environment-specific wrangler.toml configurations
- Leverage Cloudflare's edge locations for global performance
- Implement proper error handling for Worker limitations
- Use Durable Objects sparingly (not needed for this template)

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Patterns
**Best Practices**:
- Separate workflows for different environments
- Use matrix builds for parallel environment deployment
- Implement proper secret validation before deployment
- Include deployment status checks and rollback capabilities

## Security Considerations

### Bot Token Security
- Store tokens in Cloudflare Secrets (runtime)
- Never expose tokens in logs or error messages
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Use separate tokens per environment

### Webhook Validation
- Always validate Telegram webhook signatures
- Implement rate limiting for webhook endpoints
- Log security events for monitoring
- Use HTTPS-only for all webhook URLs

### Environment Isolation
- Prevent cross-environment data access
- Use environment-specific resource naming
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor for configuration drift

## Performance Optimization

### Web App Loading
- Minimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Use code splitting for large applications
- Implement service worker for caching
- Optimize images and assets

### Worker Performance
- Minimize cold start time
- Use efficient database queries
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor edge performance metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Contract Testing
- Validate API schemas with OpenAPI
- Test webhook signature validation
- Verify environment-specific configurations
- Test deployment automation

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end bot interaction testing
- Web app functionality testing
- Cross-environment deployment testing
- Performance regression testing

### Local Development Testing
- Use real bot tokens in development
- Test webhook delivery via cloudflared
- Validate environment variable loading
- Test deployment scripts locally
