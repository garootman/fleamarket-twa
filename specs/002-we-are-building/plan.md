# Implementation Plan: Telegram Web App + Bot Template Initial Deployment

**Branch**: `002-we-are-building` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-we-are-building/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a minimal working Telegram Web App + Bot template deployed on Cloudflare that displays "Hello World" messages. The template must include complete deployment setup with proper secrets management, environment separation (local/preview/prod), and comprehensive documentation to serve as a foundation for future development.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js 18+)
**Primary Dependencies**: Hono.js framework, @twa-dev/sdk, React + Vite, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: None required for Hello World template (future: D1, KV, R2)
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Cloudflare Workers + Pages, HTTPS only
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: <3 seconds loading, responsive design, 60fps interactions
**Constraints**: HTTPS only, Telegram Web App SDK integration, theme change detection, viewport handling
**Scale/Scope**: Template foundation with 3 environments (local/preview/prod), separate bot tokens per env

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Priority of Real Data**: ✅ PASS - Will use real Telegram bot tokens and actual Cloudflare deployments
**II. Correctness of Structure**: ✅ PASS - Following defined project structure for web app (frontend/backend)
**III. Supremacy of Existing Tools**: ✅ PASS - Using established Cloudflare stack, GitHub Actions, established frameworks
**IV. Double-Check of Results**: ✅ PASS - Will verify bot/web app functionality across all environments
**V. Continuity Assurance**: ✅ PASS - Will ensure no regressions, run tests before proceeding
**VI. Principle of Feasibility**: ✅ PASS - Template scope is feasible with available Cloudflare resources
**VII. Minimal Deliverables**: ✅ PASS - Starting with minimal "Hello World" functionality, verifiable via browser/curl
**VIII. Principle of No Guesswork**: ✅ PASS - All ambiguities resolved in clarification session
**IX. Task Granularity**: ✅ PASS - Will break into 1-hour chunks with verifiable results
**X. User Experience Consistency**: ✅ PASS - Following Telegram Web App SDK patterns and responsive design
**XI. Performance Requirements**: ✅ PASS - <3 second loading target, responsive design requirements defined

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend React app + Backend Cloudflare Workers with Hono.js

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Bot webhook contract → webhook handler tests and implementation [P]
- Web app API contract → API endpoint tests and implementation [P]
- Each data entity (User, BotInteraction, WebAppSession, DeploymentConfig) → model creation task [P]
- Authentication flow → JWT validation and init data verification
- Environment setup → CI/CD workflow and deployment scripts
- Documentation → README with deployment instructions

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Models → Services → Handlers → UI
- Infrastructure first: Database setup → API foundation → Bot handlers → Frontend
- Environment setup: Local → Preview → Production deployment
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent modules)

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Infrastructure & Setup** (3-4 tasks):
   - Environment configuration templates
   - CI/CD workflow setup
   - Cloudflare Workers + Pages setup

2. **Backend Implementation** (4-5 tasks):
   - Basic Hono.js server setup
   - Telegram webhook handler for /start command
   - Simple /hello API endpoint
   - Environment detection

3. **Frontend Implementation** (4-5 tasks):
   - React app structure with Vite
   - Basic Hello World page
   - Telegram Web App SDK integration (basic setup)
   - Responsive design

4. **Deployment & Webhooks** (3-4 tasks):
   - Local development with cloudflared tunnel
   - Preview/prod deployment scripts
   - Webhook URL configuration per environment
   - Environment validation scripts

5. **Documentation** (2-3 tasks):
   - Comprehensive README creation
   - Deployment instructions
   - Quickstart guide

**Estimated Output**: 16-21 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Dependency Management**:
- Environment setup must complete before deployment
- Backend webhook handler must complete before frontend integration
- Deployment scripts must complete before webhook configuration

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
