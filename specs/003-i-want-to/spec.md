# Feature Specification: Telegram Authorization System

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to add correct telegram authorization for frontend + backend. details in task01.md. sessions must be saved in KV with corresponding TTL."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: Telegram auth, session management, KV storage, TTL
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication method - initData validation, widget login, or both?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Session TTL duration not specified]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User roles/permissions structure not defined]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow identified: auth, session creation, validation, expiry
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (sessions, users, auth tokens)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties marked for clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarification)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: Session TTL duration not specified → A: 1 hour
- Q: What user data should be stored → A: ID, username, display name, userpic url
- Q: UX smoothness for Telegram Web App → A: Avoid unnecessary actions/screens, keep only essential steps
- Q: Which Telegram Web App authentication method should be implemented? → A: InitData validation only (automatic, no UI)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user opens the Telegram Web App and is automatically authenticated with minimal friction using their Telegram credentials, maintaining an authenticated session that persists across browser sessions for 1 hour. The system validates the user's identity through Telegram's authentication mechanisms and creates a secure session stored in key-value storage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user accesses the web app for the first time, **When** they initiate authentication, **Then** they are authenticated via Telegram and receive a session
2. **Given** an authenticated user with a valid session, **When** they make requests to protected endpoints, **Then** their session is validated and access is granted
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** their session expires based on TTL, **Then** they must re-authenticate to access protected resources
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they log out, **Then** their session is invalidated and removed from storage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when session data in KV storage becomes corrupted or unavailable?
- How does the system handle concurrent session validation requests for the same user?
- What occurs when a user attempts to authenticate with invalid or tampered Telegram data?
- How does the system behave when KV storage is temporarily unavailable during authentication?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users through Telegram's authentication mechanism
- **FR-002**: System MUST create and store user sessions in KV storage upon successful authentication
- **FR-003**: System MUST set TTL (time-to-live) for sessions in KV storage to 1 hour
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate session tokens for protected frontend and backend operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically expire sessions when TTL is reached
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide session invalidation capability for explicit logout
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle authentication failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent session hijacking through secure session token generation
- **FR-009**: Frontend MUST integrate with Telegram Web App authentication flow using initData validation with no additional user interface elements
- **FR-010**: Backend MUST expose authentication endpoints for session creation and validation
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain user identity information associated with active sessions including user ID, username, display name, and profile picture URL

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Session**: Represents an authenticated user's access token with expiration time, associated user identity, and session metadata
- **Telegram User**: User identity from Telegram containing user ID, username, display name, profile picture URL, and authentication status
- **Auth Token**: Secure identifier linking frontend requests to backend sessions stored in KV
