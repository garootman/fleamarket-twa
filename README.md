## What's Inside

I built this after getting tired of piecing together Telegram bot tutorials. Here's what you get:

- **Real payments** â€” Telegram Stars integration that actually works (with webhooks, refunds, the whole deal)
- **Image handling** â€” Upload, crop, compress. Stored in R2, served fast
- **Example app** â€” Instagram-style feed to show you how it all fits together
- **Full auth flow** â€” Sessions, admin roles, the security stuff you don't want to mess up
- **Local dev that works** â€” Test webhooks locally with ngrok, no deploy-pray-debug cycles

## Tech Stack

Built with tools that scale without costing you money:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript on [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)
- **Backend**: [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) + [Hono](https://hono.dev/) (like Express but faster)
- **Database**: D1 (SQLite) with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Storage**: R2 for images, KV for sessions
- **Deploy**: GitHub Actions (push to main = live in 2 minutes)
- **Testing**: Vitest for both backend and frontend

Everything's typed, tested, and ready to customize.
